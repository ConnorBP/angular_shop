[Live Demo](https://angularmagicshop.netlify.app/)

This repository has a demonstration of Angular framework version 17 usage for a simple online shopping website. I chose a magic the gathering focused game store as my store type, because I am a nerd. Inventory on the website fetches from a "json api endpoint" which is actually just a json file on the static hosting. I have also added a "network delay simulation" to allow the progress spinners to show up on the demo. This would of course not be included in a real production site.
